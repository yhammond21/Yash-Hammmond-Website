        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Yash Hammond. I was born on March 2, 2003 and I was raised in Livermore, California . I am a huge gamer and would spend every second of every day playing new video games if I did not have responsibilities to attend to. I have a dog named Mojo and I am extremely into pets. I have owned rodents, a snake, two lizards, and three toads. I will always be a die hard 49ers and warriors fan because I have to support my Bay Area teams. I graduated from Granada high school with was one of the two rival high schools in Livermore. My life up to this point has had many ups and downs but the biggest down was my dad passing away when I was 18. I was put in a unique position where I had lost my male role model and developed new money problems as well since my dad was the primary provider. Due to this I became more motivated in school, work, and my own life because the world stops for no one. 
As of writing this on November 5, 2022 I am currently employed as a line cook at Sushi Okoku and I am a full time student at the University of California Riverside with a major in Business Economics and hopes of becoming a financial planner at a business or bank. Being a chef at Sushi Okoku has allowed me to multi task more effectively, focus on the task at hand, and not crumble under extreme stress and pressure. As a student I pride myself on maintaining a 3.4 grade point average or higher, while balance extracurricular activities, work, and my own personal life. I am a member of the Hylander Financial Group which is a club where we monitor the stock market and analyze various stocks from each primary business sector. This club has given me tools that have allowed me to evaluate the stock market on a more data based level and has made me more aware of the future implications caused by current events. Additionally, the classes that I am taking have allowed me to develop beginner to intermediate experience with Microsoft Excel and Microsoft 360 as a whole. I have beginner knowledge of the inner workings and laws of micro and macro economics. I plan to both further develop the skills I already have, and learn new useful skills that I can apply to my own life. I am currently doing this by delving into new books that have been recommended by various of my friends and social media influencers. These books are ranging from personal finance books such as "Rich Dad Poor Dad" or a book that is simply just an enjoyable read, regardless my vocabulary is constantly evolving and I am exposing myself to fresh ideas. My current career and life goal is to make six figures in a job where I feel like I am making a difference. One of my biggest fears is to leave this earth and realize that I have left no mark of my existence for my friends, family, or acquaintances to remember me by.
